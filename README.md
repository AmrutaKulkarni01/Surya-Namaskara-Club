### Features left to implement
    
    - I would like to add a page displaying feedback from some former and current students of the club. 
    I will put their image and their thoughts about the club and what positive changes on health and overall life they felt, after starting suryanamaskara will be shown as a quoted text.

    After reading it, users of the website will surely be encouraged to join the club.
